  In order to follow the links of the block and use its action
  As a admin
  I need to add the Thumbnails links block to the front page

    And I am on site homepage
    When I set editing mode on
    And I add the "Thumbnail links and action" block
    And I configure the "Thumbnail links and action" block
    Then I should see "Title"
    And I should see "CALL to Action"
    And I should see "CALL to Action Title"
